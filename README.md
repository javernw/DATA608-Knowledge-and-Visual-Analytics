### GLOBAL TERRORISM DATABASE
Around the world Terrorism tends to have significant impacts on human rights with devastating consequences.
Terrorism can:
Undermine or weaken Governments.
Jeopardize national security.
Threaten peace and both social and economic development.

**The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) defines terrorism as:**

The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation.
Terrorism can take many forms and have multiple reasons leading up to the attack(s) spurning from a political or ideological goal at the expense of the general population and will always have dire consequences.


**Purpose and Relevance**

The app was build mainly for analysis using the Global Terrorism Database as a key source in order to create interative visualizations with R's Shiny or Shiny Dashboard.

As per the requirements in preparing this project, the data is of open source made available for researchers.In addition to this, the data used to create the app is only for academic purposes. The GTD is well-respected and highly-regarded as a comprehensive data source on global terrorism.


With respect to counter-terrorism:

Individuals or groups may use terrorism because they do not like the current organisation of a society and believes that it needs to change with the use of violence as there is no other choice. Due to the significant resources available to counter terrorism, it is important to analyse and aggregate the data available to better understand the various attributes.
